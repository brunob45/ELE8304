Info    : Inconsistent pin direction prevents conversion to pgpin. [PHYS-145]
        : Direction of pin 'CK' of library cell 'SRDFFRQX1' is inconsistent with direction of pin in LEF.
        : Although the pin is considered a power or ground pin in LEF, to be converted to pgpin, the direction of the pin must be consistent in both lib and LEF libraries.
